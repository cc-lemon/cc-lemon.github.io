## How do you implement hardware technology into clothing?

Depending on the brand the correct answer can be totally different. If you are Nike, some sort of motion tracker might make sense, for our client however, a non-disclosed clothing brand who focuses on gaming related apparel a motion sensor wouldnâ€™t make much sense?

So instead we created a concept where the user can show his or her rank or a specific achievement from a game. We created a concept involving a mobile app and a bendable wireless screen that the user can attach to a jacket. As a proof of concept we made a Arduino uno based prototype, which converts image files to bitmap files and displays them.

My role in this project was as facilitator for the team, user experience for the mobile app and helping out with the hardware prototype.
