Social equality and gender equality is something I'm passionate about,
and love to spend some of my free time each month doing something active about.

I'm an active volunteer in <a href="http://www.nattskiftet.org/" target="_blank">Nattskiftet</a> (swedish for Nightshift) which is an NGO working for safety and raising awareness about sexual harassment happening in 
public areas, like nightclubs and music festivals. The method is walking in and in the vicinity of nightclubs 
and music festivals acting as a sober friend for people who need us.


The second NGO is <a href="http://fatta.nu/fatta-man/" target="_blank">Fatta Man</a>,an organization working towards raising awareness about men's sexual violence towards women and non-men. The method is through workshops at schools, information targeting men through social media, a podcast and an online teaching tool in the making.
