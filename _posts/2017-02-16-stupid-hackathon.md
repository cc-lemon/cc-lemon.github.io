## Do something stupid just for fun

One cannot always use one's skills and imagination to better the world, sometimes stupid ideas are the smartest ones, maybe that was not the case of the team I participated in but in some other teams I saw great ideas.

What we created was a “web-service” called  that is always listening in on what you are saying and for a finite amount of keywords gives you an advise or looks up a wikipedia post and reads it to you, whether you want it or not.

Maybe not the most useful service but a fun way to hang-out with other developers and trying out the Web Speech API and Wikipedia’s API. The project is online at                           <a href="https://stupidhackathon.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Online app</a> CLUE: Try saying: hej, programmera, Stockholm and <a href="https://github.com/Hatlen/stupidhackaton " target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>
