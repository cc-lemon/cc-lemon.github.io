## Creative technologist and maker


What I'm always looking for is solutions, whether it’s a solution to a coding problem or how to get the team motivated again. I do front end web development, concept development, prototyping and user testing. But most of all I’m interested in being part of a great team and have fun.

I think the best environment for ideas and challenges isn’t one where you are condescending towards someone just because they aren’t running linux on their machine, but rather finding energy from differences, how small (like in this example) or big they might be.
