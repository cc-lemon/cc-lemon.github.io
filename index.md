### Creative with a Front-end development, UX and team focus

I have a passion for creating and developing concepts and ideas together with other people, from idea to going live. I believe in the power of a team to find solutions and question those solutions before going into implementation.

What I'm always looking for is solutions, whether it’s a solution to a coding problem, how to get the team motivated again or how to open a can of beans. I do concept development, front end web development, prototyping and user testing. But most of all I’m interested in being part of a great team and have fun.
